# Dijkstra's Algorithm Implementation

A python implementation of Dijkstra's Algorithm done across an ASCII map.
A starting and goal point are both designated in the my_maze.txt file.

This file represents a room with walls and travel costs from space to space.
This is parsed and searched for the shortest path from a designated goal to destination, with this path printed in the output.
In this project you can see me handle multiple different data structures, taking advantage of their unique properties. You can also see an understanding of complex algorithms, as well as a sophisticated understanding of the python language.

This project was implemented as a project for a class.

## File Descriptions

### p1.py

This file contains all of my own work for this project.

Here you can find my implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm along with several other helper functions.
I have also included functions for debugging, and ensuring the project works under all nominal and edge cases.

I've worked to make sure the code is clear and readable. I hope you think so as well!

## p1_support.py

This file contains code provided to me as a starting point for the class assignment.
This code is not my own work.

## my_maze.txt

This is the small ASCII map the algorithm will be running on. The project works on any files
of varying size, however this one is small so the shortest path can be easily seen.

X - Wall, cannot be passed through

a - starting point

d - destination point

1,2,3 - "length" of tile

### To Run

Simply download and run

```bash
python p1.py
```
